Imagine the commercial management of 26 floors\n        of office space in the Shad, London!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Homyze wanted an integrated property maintenance and facilities management solution that will\n      handle the workflow (requesting plumbers, gathering quotes, tracking onsite visit, completion\n        of jobs, issuing of invoices, payment resolution etc) and all the paperwork that follows.\n      </p>\n    ","duration":["One and a half years ongoing"],"links":[{"href":"https://www.homyze.com","label":"Homyze"},{"href":"https://cleverly.works","label":"Cleverly"}],"meta":{"description":"How Homyze and Cleverly.works digitalised facilities management","title":"Cleverly","type":"article"},"outcome":["By creating a custom application, DryKISS was able to build a desktop and mobile-friendly\n      platform that will allow clients, vendors and suppliers to have access to important data and\n      reporting at their fingertips.","The application also provided for Planned Preventative Maintenance (PPM) to be in compliance\n      with building regulations, security protocols and ensured services and equipment are\n      all maintained at regular intervals.","Real-time communication was a major feature of the platform, along with the ability to send\n      \"jobs\" with before and after photos. Customised alerts and trigger events such as sensors\n      were built into the platform to maximise usage and reduce maintenance costs ie: counting the\n      number of times a bathroom door opens will result in an automated callout for a cleaner.","Not only did it increase workflow efficiency, but it also tracked jobs and allows requests\n      to be made all online without picking up a phone.
