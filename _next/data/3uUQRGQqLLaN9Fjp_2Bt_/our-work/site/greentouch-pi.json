Stating that her overall web presence could be improved, especially in terms\n        of SEO and social marketing. Unfortunately the business didn't have a Facebook or Google\n        business page and the SEO was non-existent, barely ranking\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Having launched CodeBlender we also wanted to put this library into practice on a\n        commercial website. Quite confident that DryKISS could help this local business owner at\n        least achieve some positive SEO gains.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Business Understanding</h3>\n      <p>\n        We arranged several meetings with Ling over the next few weeks to understand where the\n        business currently was, understanding hers', the staff and client√®le's pain points.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Pain Points</h3>\n      <p>A little web technology understanding.</p>\n      <p>Had very little knowledge of SEO, social pages and Google SERPs.</p>\n      <p>Had overspent on previous web-site and didn't want to make the same mistakes.</p>\n      <p>Mixed messaging on what the business did.</p>\n      <p>\n        Memberships, promotions and loyalty cards were great but poorly conveyed and sometimes\n        overlapped.\n      </p>\n      <p>Customer's all had very positive feedback about the services.</p>\n      <p>Design and wording of marketing material was inconsistent.</p>\n      <p>No company orientated email address.</p>\n      <p>Current site was not responsive.</p>\n      <p>\n        It was originally set up in the Chinese model of a membership only spa and massage, but\n        the owners quickly realised that this probably would not work in the UK.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Goal</h3>\n      <p>\n        Before we embarked on any new site development, we wanted to investigate the pain points\n        and find solutions for as much of these as possible.\n      </p>\n      <p>Make GreenTouchPI the top Thai massage establishment on Google within 6 months.</p>\n      <p>Setup social pages; Facebook, Wahanda, now Treatwell, Google Business Page.</p>\n      <p>Establish a routine of social posting, and promotion schedule.</p>\n      <p>Create a site that was responsive, fast and met Google's latest checklist.</p>\n      <p>Simple contact and booking form.</p>\n\n      <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>\n      <p>\n        DryKISS conducted a thorough competitive analysis of the 10 or so local massage\n        establishments in the area.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Investigating the Social and SEO strategies and potential keywords and phrases they were\n        targeting. Also looking at services, pricing and promotional activities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Outcome of this was that it was entirely possible to create a SEO strategy that could\n        compete if not outstrip these competitors.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Keyword Research</h3>\n      <p>\n        DryKISS drafted a thorough report on the phrases used by local residents around massage\n        services. We identified many keywords, terms and phrases we should look at incorporating\n        on all messaging the organisation sends out.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Development</h3>\n      <p>\n        A small budget was put in place to carry out this transformation. It meant that we could\n        not utilise the usual DryKISS design process.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We opted to use a generic Bootstrap styled site, to inherently give us a responsive\n        design, it therefore meant we could rapidly build pages and focus resource and budget on\n        the digital marketing aspect of the plan.\n      </p>\n    ","duration":["5 days research and reporting","5 days development"],"links":[{"href":"http://greentouchpi.com/","label":"Greentouch PI"}],"meta":{"description":"Greentouch PI","title":"Greentouch PI","type":"article"},"outcome":["Page 1 on Google for search phrase \"Massage Wimbledon\"","Business up 600% since launch","4x the original staff levels"],"slug":"greentouch-pi","tasks":["Keyword research","SEO","UX","Design","Responsive development","Deployment","Analytics","Google search console","Social pages, Facebook, Google and Wahanda"],"team":["Ian Warner - Technical lead","May Tran - Digital Marketing"],"title":"Greentouch PI","type":"site"}},"__N_SSG":true}
