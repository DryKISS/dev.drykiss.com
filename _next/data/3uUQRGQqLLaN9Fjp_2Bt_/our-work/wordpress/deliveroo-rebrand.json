These edits were forming part of the new Deliveroo\n        brand launch on Sunday 4th September 2016.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The blog actually consisted of a Wordpress multisite holding seven international blogs in\n        7 different languages! Each one would have to have access to a CMS with the ability to\n        edit, reviewed and published by several content managers.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Business understanding</h3>\n      <p>\n        The discovery phase for the work required had to be undertaken over Skype due to the\n        tight deadline. DryKISS set up a scrum Trello board and placed all the features\n        and work packages that needed to be delivered.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We then liaised through Trello to achieve a slick communication between DryKISS,\n        internal designer and the Content manager.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Pain points</h3>\n      <p>Blog had to be deployed through another third party company</p>\n      <p>Getting setup on the development system was unknown</p>\n      <p>Wordpress setup was unknown</p>\n\n      <h3>Developement</h3>\n      <p>\n        The Wordpress theme and internal mechanics were understood quickly. So it was then just\n        a matter of pushing through the CSS changes, checking against cross-browser\n        compatibility, responsive look and feel and new font inclusion.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        DryKISS completed the changes to allow a full spectrum text by the client. Everything was\n        deployed at midnight with just some minor changes to the caching mechanism to set it live.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Not only has Deliveroo FoodScene reached a wider audience through its daily blog (covering\n        such topics as insider profiles on some of the top restaurants around the world, secret\n        recipes from chefs etc), it has also increased its brand reach, helped customers choose a\n        tasty Friday night meal and provided SEO opportunities for its website.\n      </p>\n    ","duration":["3 days development"],"links":[{"href":"https://foodscene.deliveroo.co.uk","label":"Deliveroo Blog"}],"meta":{"description":"Deliveroo - Food home delivery","title":"Rebranding Deliveroo FoodScene blog","type":"article"},"outcome":["Delivered edits on time","Deployed at midnight"],"slug":"deliveroo-rebrand","tasks":["Wordpress theme edits","Wordpress plug-in edits","Responsive development","Deployment"],"team":["Ian Warner - Technical Lead"],"title":"Deliveroo Rebrand","type":"wordpress"}},"__N_SSG":true}
