Created in 2005 it\n        included most of the mechanics we now see on Uber or Hailo. However the smartphone was\n        not in existence then!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At its basic level it matched client to taxi through various means including; mobile\n        triangulation; postcode voice recognition and GPS if available. It would then match the\n        nearest driver and route the call directly to their hands free mobile.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Beep was all about putting the user in control. Providing safety options such as call\n        recording and constant taxi tracking. Beep would simply take 1 per journey.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Unfortunately due to lack of funding Beep Taxi was closed in 2007; it's a shame to think\n        that Britain could have had a billion dollar business like Uber in 2005, if back then we\n        had the investment mentality like in the US.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        DryKISS as a partner, were tasked with the technical architecture and development of\n        this complex system.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Firstly we needed to track the Taxi, to do this a custom GPS / GSM device was\n        manufactured and installed in over 100 test taxis in Reading. A basic toggle switch\n        alerted the system of the vehicle's availability. Each was also fitted with a SIM to\n        provide the location data we required.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        To locate the client we crafted an IVR platform that provided all the options the user\n        would need to book a taxi. If they called on a mobile phone we would instantly locate\n        them; a land line, prompted the IVR to ask for a postcode through voice recognition.\n        Additional prompts asked if they wanted the taxi now or in the future. Culminating in\n        the call being routed to the nearest available Beep driver, to give reassurance of\n        pick-up time and location.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        An after journey rating system was created by sending the user an SMS, they simply\n        needed to reply with a 1-5 score.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Lastly a complex back office and API platform was developed to handle all the IVR\n        information; GPS data from the taxis and order routing. Algorithms processed the best\n        taxi for the user based on distance, ratings and journey time. A full reporting engine\n        gave the business the transparency of best drivers, popular pick up areas and advocate\n        customers. Also the means to invoice and track payments from drivers.\n      </p>\n    ","duration":[],"links":[{"href":"http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/now-you-can-beep-you-4263837","label":"Beep Taxi"}],"meta":{"description":"Beep Taxi","title":"Beep Taxi","type":"article"},"outcome":[],"slug":"beep-taxi","tasks":[],"team":["Ian Warner - Developer"],"title":"Beep Taxi","type":"site"},{"active":true,"author":"Ian Warner","client":"deliveroo","cover":"/images/portfolio/deliveroo/excuse-generator/hero.png","description":"\n      <p>\n        DryKISS completed what is the most ambitious digital marketing build for Deliveroo in\n        it's history.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        They required in a short development window the development of a global site for their\n        #AnyExcuse campaign.\n      </p>\n    ","duration":["3 weeks development"],"links":[{"href":"http://excuse-generator.com/","label":"Deliveroo Excuse generator"}],"meta":{"description":"Deliveroo - Excuse generator","title":"Deliveroo - Excuse generator","type":"article"},"outcome":["Delivered on time","Many change requests handled"],"slug":"excuse-generator","tasks":["Marketing application","7 languages","Automatic image generation","Social sharing","Adaptive development","Analytics"],"team":["Ian Warner - Technical Lead"],"title":"Deliveroo Excuse Generator","type":"site"},{"active":false,"author":"Ian Warner","client":"dungbeetle","cover":"/images/portfolio/dungbeetle/logotribe/hero.png","description":"","duration":[],"links":[],"meta":{"description":"Logotribe","title":"Logotribe","type":"article"},"outcome":[],"slug":"logotribe","tasks":[],"team":["Ian Warner - Developer"],"title":"Logotribe","type":"site"},{"active":true,"author":"Ian Warner","client":"drykiss","cover":"/images/portfolio/drykiss/greentouch-pi/greentouch-contact.png","description":"\n      <p>\n        After enjoying one of the best Thai massages I have ever had in the UK; I confronted the\n        owner Ling.

So it was then just\n        a matter of pushing through the CSS changes, checking against cross-browser\n        compatibility, responsive look and feel and new font inclusion.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        DryKISS completed the changes to allow a full spectrum text by the client. Everything was\n        deployed at midnight with just some minor changes to the caching mechanism to set it live.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Not only has Deliveroo FoodScene reached a wider audience through its daily blog (covering\n        such topics as insider profiles on some of the top restaurants around the world, secret\n        recipes from chefs etc), it has also increased its brand reach, helped customers choose a\n        tasty Friday night meal and provided SEO opportunities for its website.\n      </p>\n    ","duration":["3 days development"],"links":[{"href":"https://foodscene.deliveroo.co.uk","label":"Deliveroo Blog"}],"meta":{"description":"Deliveroo - Food home delivery","title":"Rebranding Deliveroo FoodScene blog","type":"article"},"outcome":["Delivered edits on time","Deployed at midnight"],"slug":"deliveroo-rebrand","tasks":["Wordpress theme edits","Wordpress plug-in edits","Responsive development","Deployment"],"team":["Ian Warner - Technical Lead"],"title":"Deliveroo Rebrand","type":"wordpress"},{"active":true,"author":"Ian Warner","client":"drykiss","cover":"/images/portfolio/drykiss/circus-street/circus-street-home-mobile.jpeg","description":"\n      <p>DryKISS made contact with Circus Street through the YunoJuno platform.</p>\n\n      <p>\n        They were in quite a desperate need for some rapid development and decisions on the\n        direction of their Hybrid project.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        They had already built a native iPad application previously, but wanted to use the\n        Cordova technology to enable a cross platform, multi-device experience.\n      </p>\n    ","duration":["3 month development"],"links":[],"meta":{"description":"Circus Street - Video e-learning platform","title":"Circus Street - Video e-learning platform","type":"article"},"outcome":["Deployed new hybrid apps to iOS and Android","Engagement rising on both apps"],"slug":"circus-street","tasks":["Hybrid mobile development","Offline capabilities","Responsive development","Deployment","Analytics"],"team":["Ian Warner - Developer"],"title":"Circus Street","type":"mobile"},{"active":false,"author":"Ian Warner","client":"ibm","cover":"/images/portfolio/ibm/iris/hero.png","description":"\n      <p>\n        Sales enablement hybrid iPad application to facilitate the client seller communication\n      </p>\n    ","duration":[],"links":[],"meta":{"description":"Sales enablement hybrid iPad application to facilitate the client seller communication","title":"IBM - Iris","type":"article"},"outcome":[],"slug":"iris","tasks":[],"team":["Ian Warner - Developer"],"title":"Ibm Iris","type":"mobile"},{"active":false,"author":"Ian Warner","client":"jack-morton","cover":"/images/portfolio/jack-morton/sabic/hero.png","description":"","duration":["7 days development"],"links":[],"meta":{"description":"Jack Morton Sabic","title":"Jack Morton Sabic","type":"article"},"outcome":[],"slug":"sabic","tasks":[],"team":["Ian Warner - Technical lead"],"title":"Jack Morton Sabic","type":"mobile"},{"active":false,"author":"Ian Warner","client":"jack-morton","cover":"/images/portfolio/jack-morton/samsung/hero.png","description":"","duration":[],"links":[{"href":"http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/samsung-galaxy-studio-showcases-devices-portobello-road/destinations/article/1217188","label":"Jack Morton Samsung"}],"meta":{"description":"Jack Morton Samsung","title":"Jack Morton Samsung","type":"article"},"outcome":[],"slug":"samsung","tasks":[],"team":["Ian Warner - Developer"],"title":"Jack Morton Samsung","type":"mobile"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
